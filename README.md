## CGScratch: an example of using CoreGraphics to achieve a scratch-card effect

I had to code a scratch-card effect for an iPhone app and started looking around for an example.
Did not find any. I did find, however, that this was a frequently asked feature.

So here we are, with a simple implementation of how this could be done.

It is the simplest way you could achieve this, I think.
Of course, your needs may differ, but it should get you started.

Keep track of memory, I did not pay particular attention to memory management.
